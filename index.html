  <h5> Guidance </h5>
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px; text-align: center;"> 40 Euro per session (apr. 1 hour) </p>
  <p>People have always sought after a deeper meaning to life, the universe and everything. This search is build into our nature.<br>
  Where in the past most people would be born into a religion that solved this quest for them, these days of secularisation, many are searching for their own meaning of life.<br>
Guidance for spiritual direction is not the same as 'therapy'. These sessions are not about fixing yourself, rather about finding yourself and how you relate to spirit.<br> <br>

<p>Having confidence on where you stand on spiritual matters can have tremendous benefit in your daily life. Since guidance for spiritual direction is based on what you believe as opposed to what
the guidance counselor beliefs, you have the opportunity to really deep-dive into your soul.<br>
<br>
CC holds a degree in social work and a certificate in spiritual counseling, she was ordained as an interfaith minister in 2017. With a lifelong interest in psychology, philosophy and spiritual matters, she is able to guide you through
deep conversation and hold you in sacred space. <br>
<br>
Spiritual guidance is open to all, regardless of your spiritual background (if any). Sessions can be in person or over Skype.<br>

  <p>CC is trained in the following healing techniques, <a href="#reiki" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" title="Reiki" data-content="Reiki is an ancient Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is based on the idea that an unseen life force energy flows through us which causes us to be alive. 
The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means God's Wisdom or the Higher Power and Ki which is life force energy - So Reiki is actually spiritually guided life force energy.
Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing.
Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. 
(CC teaches Reiki on a 1:1 level, please contact her for further information)">Reiki</a>, <a href="#seichem" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" title="Seichem" data-content="Seichem is one of the healing arts practised in ancient Egypt. Reiki is one of the four elemental rays which make up Seichem - earth (Reiki), water, air and fire.
Seichem connects with our higher selves to establish healing in the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. The energy is used to heal and stimulate personal development and growth.
">Seichem</a>, <a href="#IET" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" title="IET" data-content="IET is also called ‘Healing with the Angels’, Integrated Energy Therapy uses a violet angelic energy ray, channelled from the Angelic Realm. During an IET angel healing session there are nine angels that are channelled for assistance: 
Archangel Ariel, Archangel Raphael, Archangel Gabriel, Angel Celestina, Angel Faith, Angel Cassiel, Angel Daniel, Angel Sarah and Archangel Michael. IET angel healing works directly with your 12-Strand Spiritual DNA and supports you in releasing limiting energy patterns of your past, empowering and balancing your life in the present, helping you to reach for the stars as you evolve into your future.">IET</a>, 
<a href="#Magnified" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" title="Magnified Healing" data-content="Magnified Healing's focus is on the heart - Unconditional Spiritual Love and Compassion, we build our Light Body, we work with the Spiritual Hierarchy of Ascended Masters, and we are of service to others. Magnified Healing is used for distant healing, healing karma, building the Light Body, activating all the strands of DNA as well as healing the Earth. 
">Magnified Healing </a> and <a href="#angel" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" title="Angelic Healing" data-content="During an angelic healing session we call upon angelic beings to assist with healing of the client on a physical, emotional and spiritual level. Angelic energy can be seen as a lovely golden beam of light that will channel from the angelic realms through the therapist. The energy is of pure love and light, which will radiate through the client’s body.
Often a client will see, feel or sense the energy, which is a very soothing experience. The therapist will scan the client’s body for any areas that need healing. We ask the client’s healing guides and guardian angel to guide this process.
">Angelic healing</a>.
<br>
After providing healing sessions to many clients over the last decade, CC developed her own intuitive healing style.<br>
Based on the techniques she is trained in, she will allow her intuition to speak during each healing session as to what is energetically asked for.<br>
She will always connect to and work with the individual's healing angels and spirit guides, channeling healing as it is needed.</p>

<p>Each session will start with a conversation, to check in and see where the client wants to focus on during the session.<br>
At the end of the healing session, CC will guide you through a grounding exercise and after she will talk with the client about what was experienced during the session.
In her experience, each healing session, even with the same client, is completely unique. If anything, most people experience a feeling of deep relaxation. 
<br>
It is extremely important to note that this is a complementary therapy, though relief from medical issues can be experienced, you should never stop taking regular medication
or stop seeing your regular doctor. CC does not have a medical degree and can therefor not provide medical consultation.

  <p style="background-color: rgba(0,77,19); padding: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%; margin-left:0; margin-right: 0;">
  CC always had a curiousity about all things spiritual, though she never expected to become a professional holistic practioner.
  It was only after she had a deep spiritual experience shortly after her father's passing that she realized her path might have to take a more spiritual turn.
  Deeply grounded in the here and now, with a healthy amount of skepticism and a good dose of humour, CC has found her own way of working with spirit.<br>
  Having a deep understanding of where spiritual concepts came from and being mindful in honouring the intention of rituals is most important to CC and she believes
  it helps her in guiding and teaching others.<br>
  CC was ordained as an interfaith minister in 2017. She writes a <a href="https://www.interfaithministerireland.org" target="_blank">blog</a> promoting the interfaith dialogue, 
  and works as a volunteer chaplain for the Alzheimer Society Ireland.<br> 
Trained in spiritual counseling, she holds a degree in Social Work and has a lifelong interest in psychology and philosophy.<br> 
As an unlimited being she also holds a degree in web technologies and creates lovely websites such as this one &#9786;.<br>
